    welcome: `<b>WELCOME!</b> <br><br> 
    There are only two rooms, the one above
    is my pursuits and the one ahead is about me. I would like to extend a huge thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JSLegendDev">JSLegendDev</a> 
    because of a tutorial he made on how to do a site like this.`,
   
    "about me": `<b>ABOUT ME</b><br><br>
    Keeping it brief, I enjoy computer science and over the years have slowly
    developed a like for math. At the same time I've also started to, hehe, hate web development(hence the game your on). I guess it's the 
    html, css, and js part that kills me. Anyways, as of right now I'm quite broke and have no job. Aside from my career related things 
    I enjoy Minecraft pvp and cooking. Aaaaaaaand that's it, I got nothing more to say about myself.`,
   
    fridge: `<b>FRIDGE</b> <br><br>
    A bit late on the food update, as of now its 7:54 pm and I just ate tacos. They were quite good except birria(idk if thats how its spelled)
    goes better with the orange sauce it usually has. These that my mom made didn't have it but they were still pretty dang good. `,
   
    misc: `<b>MISC</b> <br><br> 
    Random things I find on the internet, 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV_lf1kyV9M">CS Architecture in Minecraft</a>
        </li>
    </ul>`,
    
    hobbies: `<b>HOBBIES</b> <br><br> 
    I really like to cook, it's something about making your own food over eating at a place that makes cooking so much fun. 
    I'm still learning a ton but watching Nick DiGiovanni and master chef always made me want to do better on my cooking skills. My goal 
    for this hobby is to eventually do a beef wellington, which is not easy by any means but it will be very rewarding. 
    <br><br>
    Aside from cooking I'm a hardcore Minecraft pvp'er, it's not a word but who cares! I really hoped to get a gaming pc this year, but my 
    trashy-self for some reason can't get a job so my dreams of recording some of my cracked gameplay are ruined. Sorry but I have to vent,
    if I had a pc I would be a way better better player as my Xbox One severly holds me back. Hopefully I get one soon as it's not 
    only useful for that but also many other things related to my career.`,
    
    achievements: `<b>ACHIEVEMENTS</b> <br><br> 
    Idk, I'm not really impressive at the moment.`,
    
    "current work": `<b>CURRENT WORK</b> <br><br> 
    I'm currently reading a discrete math book from school that basically no one in the class finished because it was so dang
    time consuming, especially in the middle of school year. I did figure though that reading this book will help me advanced in CS and I could 
    to a lot of mini projects due to its nature. Aside from that I'm also practicing for the Alec's test because I don't want to do these useless
    math courses in college.`,

    "past work": `<b>PAST WORK</b> <br><br> 
    As time progresses I will import all my work from my old site to the new one, at the current moment I feel unmotivated to do a 
    bunch of work. This procrastination is gonna bite me back me real bad lol.`,
